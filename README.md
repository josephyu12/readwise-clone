# Freedwise

A web application that resurfaces your highlights in daily summaries, built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase.

## Features

- **Rich Text Highlights**: Add highlights with formatting support (bold, italic, underline, bullet points, numbered lists)
- **Notion Import**: Import highlights from Notion pages - each empty line becomes a new highlight, with rich text formatting preserved
- **Category Tags**: Organize highlights with custom category tags
- **Highlight Linking**: Link highlights together with hyperlinked text references
- **Rating System**: Rate highlights (high/med/low) in daily summaries
- **Automatic Archiving**: Highlights marked as "low" twice are automatically archived and excluded from daily reviews
- **Monthly Review**: Every highlight appears once per month in daily summaries
- **Daily Summaries**: View resurfaced highlights organized by date
- **Modern UI**: Responsive design with dark mode support

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up Supabase:
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Get your project URL and API key from the project settings
   - **Recommended**: Use the new **Publishable key** (`sb_publishable_...`) from the API Keys section
   - **Alternative**: You can also use the legacy `anon` key (JWT-based), but publishable keys are recommended

3. Create environment variables:
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
   - Add the following:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
   # OR use the legacy name (both work):
   # NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_publishable_key_or_anon_key
   ```
   
   **Optional - For automatic daily imports from Notion:**
   ```
   NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_api_key
   NOTION_PAGE_ID=your_notion_page_id
   NOTION_SOURCE=optional_source_name
   NOTION_AUTHOR=optional_author_name
   CRON_SECRET=your_random_secret_string
   ```
   
   **Note**: The code supports both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (recommended) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (legacy) for backward compatibility. Both work with new publishable keys and legacy anon keys.
   
   **Where to find your keys**:
   - Go to your Supabase project → Settings → API Keys
   - For new keys: Copy the **Publishable key** (starts with `sb_publishable_...`)
   - For legacy keys: Copy the `anon` key from the **Legacy API Keys** tab

4. Set up the database schema:
   - Run the SQL script in `supabase/schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
   - If you already have the database set up, run these migration scripts in order:
     - `supabase/migration_add_months_reviewed.sql` - Adds months reviewed tracking
     - `supabase/migration_add_archived.sql` - Adds archiving functionality

5. Install dependencies (including PDF parsing library):
```bash
npm install
```

6. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Database Schema

The application uses the following tables:
- `highlights`: Stores your highlights with rich text content, ratings, metadata, and archived status
- `categories`: Stores category tags for organizing highlights
- `highlight_categories`: Junction table linking highlights to categories
- `highlight_links`: Stores links between highlights
- `highlight_months_reviewed`: Tracks which months each highlight has been reviewed
- `daily_summaries`: Stores daily summary records
- `daily_summary_highlights`: Junction table linking summaries to highlights with ratings

See `supabase/schema.sql` for the complete schema.
